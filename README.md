##Coding guidelines
===================

*Use comments and annotate! Tons! Just go to town with the comments!
*Indent with the Eclipse IDE style:

        method()
        {
              variables
        
              statements()
              {
                    conditions and output
              }
        }
  
*if using eclipse, press ctrl-a then ctrl-i to do that automatically.

*test before submitting a pull request

##Terms of Use
==================
I give permission to use this source code to help you create your own mods one the condition that those mods
have substantial changes to the code. In other words, don't copy and paste and claim as your own.
I'm releasing the code NOT so that others can make their own slender man mods, but so that those that want to 
use such methods as "field of view checking for entities" and completely randomised teleporting and such.

TL;DR
Don't copy the source code, unless you're using it to make a different mod.
